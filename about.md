Hello! I'm a human on Earth and I currently earn money working as a Software Engineer for [CRITICAL Software][cs-page]. 

I enjoy creating web applications using modern web technologies like ES6, React and Node, as well as playing drums and Mexican food.

If you're interested, you can find my repositories spread across [GitLab][gitlab] and [GitHub][github]. Originally only GitLab offered unlimited private repos, but with GitHub lifting the restriction, and with my ever increasing frustration with GitLab, I am in the process of migrating my repositories back to GitHub.

This site is a collection of things I wanted to learn more about, and I've found no better way to learn things than try to teach them to someone else. Having to write something down in a less technical manner requires a good understanding of the concept in the first place, so I find it a good way to force myself to properly learn the topic.
